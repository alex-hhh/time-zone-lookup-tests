;; Calculate the winding number of POLYGON as seen from the point at LAT,LON.

;; the polygon.
;;
;; Unlike the official winding number definition which is an integer, we
;; return a partial winding number, mostly to account for floating point
;; errors in our large and irregular polygons.  Also, the official winding
;; number definition has a sign, being negative if the polygon is traversed in
;; clockwise direction, but we don't care about that either, returning the
;; absolute value instead.
